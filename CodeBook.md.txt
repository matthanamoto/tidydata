Variables of Interest:

Note: There were two sets of datasets that needed to be combined for analysis purposes. One set was a Training dataset and the other set was a test dataset. 
Both the training and test dataset, were split into three datasets: activities, features, and subjects.

Also, there were two label datasets that contained names of the activities tracked in the data and names of each feature tracked in the data.
Those variables were labeled as "activity.labels" and "feature.names".

activity.data: Combined data frame of activity Test and Train datasets
features.data: Combined data frame of features Test and Train datasets
subject.data:  Combined data frame of subject Test and Train datasets

All.Data: Combined dataset of activity, features, and subject combined datasets.
Extracted.data: Extracted the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
ExtractAndActivity: Matched each activity listed in the "activity.labels" dataframe to the individual measurements.
Tidy.Data: The average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
